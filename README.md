# Database-Normalization-and-Extendible-Hasing
1) Database normalization- Given a set of attributes and their keys and functional dependencies,
we constructed an algorithm to normalise the given relation to a higher normal form.
2) Extendible Hashing- Given GD,LD,hash-function and Bfr, we have to simulate the Extendible Hashing scheme using GUI.
This included insertion,deletion and much more functions.
